# Cuddler Webring
Inspired by the long-defunct CuddleLand Webring of the 1990s, this is a [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) in which all the members love cuddling!  
If you love cuddles and have a personal website, you might be interested in [joining the webring]({{'join'|relative_url}}).

If the ring is broken, please [submit an error report on GitHub]({{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/new/choose).
