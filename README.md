This is a [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)'s [static routing redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/).

This isn't intended to be a template, but it seems to be unique from all other webring frameworks on GitHub,
so I have made [a tutorial on making webrings with the same framework](https://mincerafter42.github.io/tutorial/webring/).
